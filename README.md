### Howdy!ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jack! I am an enthusiastic and ambitious individual with a passion for data science and its incredible potential to drive positive change. I recently graduated from the renowned Le Wagon Tokyo, where I honed my skills and acquired a solid foundation in data science.

ðŸ“š Throughout my journey at Le Wagon, I immersed myself in a comprehensive curriculum that covered key concepts and practical tools in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. From Python to SQL, Pandas to Matplotlib, I developed a versatile skill set that empowers me to extract valuable insights from complex datasets.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I have a back ground in Japanese stage plays (kyogen)
